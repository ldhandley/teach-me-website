# teach-me-website

> **Student**: Can you teach me how to make a website?

**Teacher**: Why do you want to make a website?

> **Student**: I want to make a new blog website for myself.

**Teacher**: What's the mission of the blog? 

> **Student**: To have a place where people can learn about me and read about my story. I want a blog to help build a personal brand. 

**Teacher**: How many pages will you have, and what will their names be?

> **Student** To start, I want a homepage called "Lindsey Handley" that links to at least 1 blog post called "My Story". 

**Teacher**: Okay, let's put a prototype together.  Install the `website` package from https://github.com/thoughtstem/website.  Look at the `my-site.rkt` demo, and copy something like that into this repo to express how your homepage and post link up.
